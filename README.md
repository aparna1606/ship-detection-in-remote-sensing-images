# ship-detection-in-remote-sensing-images

Ships are the main transport system on the vast oceans which raises the concern over traffic surveillance, maritime security, protection against illegal fisheries etc. Satellite Image processing techniques have developed in the past few years that help in monitoring the sea surface for security and traffic analysis. Depending on the shape and dimensions of a ship, they are classified into various types such as bulk carrier, container, tanker etc. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. These remote sensing images are saved in jpg format in the dataset. These images are passed to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the ships. Python libraries like opencv, tensorflow, pytorch, keras, scikit-learn can be used. Accuracy and F1 scores of the model are calculated to evaluate the model.
